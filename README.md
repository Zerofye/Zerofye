# Zerofye
MC: Bedrock edition server software written in PHP

# What is this?
If you don't already know.. then I don't know what else to tell you. But anyhow,
I am working on this project because it's fun, you're always welcome to contribute.
Again, this project is something I feel as a sort of challenge, or better of, a spark.

# How does it work?

It's simple, but, I'm not yet going to be posting a `how to set it up` tutorial yet. But it simple as grabing a PHP >= 7.2 bin and running ```Zeruxa.bat``` But again, I'm not worrying about this yet because I still have lots to do, but I'm sure you can find how it works yourself!

# Performance

I don't have to explain it at all, you'll already feel it just by **running** it :P

Lasty, I hope you find it useful!
